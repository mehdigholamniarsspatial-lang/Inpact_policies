# Ireland GHG Policy Impact Explorer — Django + Vercel

A minimal Django platform that serves the INPACT / Ireland Greenhouse Gas
Policy Impact Explorer single-page app. Built to deploy on Vercel's
zero-configuration Django runtime.

```

## Satellite base map

The Explorer uses Esri World Imagery's public raster tile service as its only
base map, preserving the station markers and emissions overlays. No API key
or environment variable is required. Imagery attribution is displayed on the
map. The service requires an internet connection.

## Editing the data

All emissions values come from **`data/ghg_inventory.csv`**. Edit that file and
reload the page in the browser — the time-series chart, the indicator switcher
(Total GHG / CO₂ / CH₄ / …), the no-policy baseline, the projection band and the
headline KPIs all recompute automatically. No code change or migration needed.

The CSV is wide format: the first column is `year`, and each remaining column is
one gas series in **kt CO₂-equivalent**. Column headers must match the indicator
keys used by the page (e.g. `All greenhouse gases`, `CO2`,
`CH4 - (CO2 equivalent)`, …). A blank cell means "no data" for that year (the
chart draws a gap). Add rows to extend the timeline (e.g. a `2025` row) and the
observed window updates on its own.

The *observed* line is your CSV data. The baseline counterfactual,
policy-adjusted pathway, forecast and 95% confidence band are computed **from**
those observed values by the model in `index.html`; the map markers remain
illustrative placeholders.

## Tabbed dashboard

The platform is organised into three tabs (a bar sits directly under the
header):

* **Explorer** — the full analytical dashboard (filters sidebar, emissions
  chart, map, policy intelligence, roadmap, climate-targets cards). Unchanged
  from before, just wrapped in its own tab.
* **About INPACT** — a content page describing the project (mission, what we do,
  why it matters, data sources, the full team, and a closing statement). The
  copy mirrors the project's *About INPACT* document.
* **Feedback** — a public-participation form whose submissions are written to an
  Excel workbook (see below).

## Feedback → Excel on GitHub

Submissions from the **Feedback** tab POST to `/api/feedback/`. Each one is
appended as a row to an Excel workbook (`data/feedback.xlsx`). Because Vercel's
serverless filesystem is **read-only**, the workbook is persisted by committing
it back to the GitHub repository through the GitHub Contents API — so the repo
itself is the durable store and the `.xlsx` can be downloaded straight from
GitHub at `data/feedback.xlsx`.

Behaviour is controlled by environment variables:

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | PAT with `contents: write` on the repo. **If unset, feedback is written to local disk instead** (handy for local dev). | _(none)_ |
| `GITHUB_REPO` | `owner/name` to commit into. | `MehdiGalway/INPACT_V2` |
| `GITHUB_BRANCH` | Branch to commit to. | `main` |
| `FEEDBACK_PATH` | Path of the workbook inside the repo. | `data/feedback.xlsx` |

**Local development:** don't set `GITHUB_TOKEN`. Submit feedback and open the
generated `data/feedback.xlsx` directly.

**Production (Vercel):** create a fine-grained Personal Access Token scoped to
this repo with **Contents: Read and write**, then add it as the `GITHUB_TOKEN`
environment variable in your Vercel project settings. Submissions will then be
committed to `data/feedback.xlsx` in the repo automatically.

Two routes back the feature:

* `POST /api/feedback/` — record a submission (JSON or form-encoded).
* `GET  /api/feedback/download/` — download the current workbook as
  `inpact_feedback.xlsx` (pulls from GitHub when a token is set, else local
  disk). There is also a **Download .xlsx** button on the Feedback tab.

> ⚠️ Never commit your `GITHUB_TOKEN`. Keep it in environment variables only.

### Policy timeline — `data/policies.csv`

The climate-policy layer comes from **`data/policies.csv`**; edit it and reload.
Columns: `year, name, level, agency, sector, type, instrument, description,
direction, outcome`.

* **`level`** is one of `International`, `EU`, `National` or `Target`, and drives
  the colour everywhere (navy / teal / emerald / amber) plus the sidebar
  **Policy Interventions** checkboxes. Ticking a jurisdiction shows that group's
  dashed guide-lines on the chart, each annotated with a vertical (rotated)
  label; years with several policies show the lead one plus a `+N` badge. The
  `Target` rows (2030 / 2050) are always shown in amber.
* The same records build the **Climate Policy Roadmap** timeline and populate the
  **Policy Intelligence Panel** (direction, lead body, instrument, outcome,
  description) when a node is clicked — so one CSV feeds the whole page.
* Add, remove or re-date rows freely; counts, timeline and chart update on reload.

## Run locally

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate          # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py runserver
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:8000

## Deploy on Vercel

Vercel auto-detects `manage.py`, reads `WSGI_APPLICATION` from settings, and
runs `collectstatic` automatically. No `vercel.json` is required.

In your Vercel project settings add an environment variable:

- `SECRET_KEY` — any long random string (used by Django).

Then connect the GitHub repo and deploy. See the full walkthrough you were
given alongside this project.

## Raster overlays — Spatial Environmental Mapping

The map panel (tab **Explorer → 2B**) can overlay raster (`.tif`) layers on the
Leaflet map, driven by three **cascading dropdowns**: Year → Sector → Parameter.

### Where the files live and how they're named

Drop GeoTIFFs into **`data/Raster/`** using the convention:

```
<Year>_<Sector>_<Parameter>.tif
```

e.g. `2019_B_Industry_pbenzoA.tif` → Year `2019`, Sector `B_Industry`,
Parameter `pbenzoA`. The Year is the first token, the Parameter is the last
token, and the Sector is everything in between (so a sector may itself contain
an underscore, like `B_Industry`).

The folder is **re-scanned on every request**, so new files appear in the
dropdowns automatically — no code change or server restart needed. Files that
don't match the convention are ignored.

### What the overlay does

* Reprojects the raster (any CRS, e.g. Irish Grid EPSG:29902) to Web-Mercator so
  it lines up with the basemap.
* Applies a **rainbow** colour map on a **logarithmic** scale (these emission
  rasters span several orders of magnitude), with robust 2nd/98th-percentile
  endpoints.
* **Masks zero and nodata cells** — they are fully transparent and never drawn.
* Draws a matching **colour-bar legend** (bottom-left of the map) with the value
  range.
* Selecting a new Year/Sector/Parameter **replaces** the previous overlay.
* An all-zero raster is detected and reported instead of drawing a blank layer.

### Endpoints

| Route | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `GET /api/rasters/` | Nested catalogue `{year:{sector:{parameter:filename}}}` for the dropdowns |
| `GET /api/raster/meta/?year=&sector=&parameter=` | Bounds (WGS84), value range, colour stops, scale, all-zero flag |
| `GET /api/raster/image/?year=&sector=&parameter=` | The rendered RGBA PNG (rainbow, zeros transparent) |

Rendering lives in `explorer/rasters.py`; the endpoints are in
`explorer/views.py`; the dropdowns, overlay logic and legend are in
`explorer/page/index.html`.

### Extra dependencies

`rasterio`, `numpy` and `Pillow` (added to `requirements.txt`). `rasterio`
ships self-contained binary wheels (bundled GDAL) on PyPI, so a plain
`pip install -r requirements.txt` is enough for local development. For Vercel,
note that GDAL-backed wheels are large; if the serverless bundle exceeds limits,
pre-render the PNGs or host the raster API separately.

## Trend Analysis tab (merged Streamlit dashboard)

The former standalone Streamlit "Piecewise Regression Dashboard" is now a
native page of this Django program — no Streamlit process or iframe needed.

- `explorer/trend_engine.py` — numerical core ported verbatim from the
  Streamlit app's `regression.py` (piecewise OLS / Huber / Theil–Sen fits,
  Mann–Kendall test, Sen's slope, prediction bands). Pure
  numpy / scipy / statsmodels; unit-testable in isolation.
- `explorer/trend_views.py` — JSON API:
  - `GET  /api/trend/catalog/` — gases, sector lists, year axis
  - `GET  /api/trend/series/?gas=&sector=` — raw series
  - `POST /api/trend/fit/` — fit + statistics + diagnostics
- Front-end: the "Trend Analysis" tab in `explorer/page/index.html`
  (Chart.js, already loaded by the page). Includes segment-statistics table,
  Mann–Kendall / Sen's-slope KPIs, residual diagnostics, and CSV / PNG export.

Data source is the SAME `data/sector_inventory/{Total,CO2,CH4,N2O}.csv`
files used by the Explorer's Sector Explorer — single source of truth.

### Run locally

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt  # now includes scipy + statsmodels
python manage.py runserver
# open http://127.0.0.1:8000/ and click the "Trend Analysis" tab
```

Note for Vercel: scipy/statsmodels exceed the serverless bundle limit. If you
redeploy to Vercel, either strip the two trend dependencies (the tab will
show an API error but the rest of the site works) or host on a VM/PaaS that
supports full Python (EC2, PythonAnywhere, Railway, etc.).
